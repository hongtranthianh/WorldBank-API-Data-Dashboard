# WorldBank-Data-Dashboard

Develop and deploy a data dashboard as a web app using Bootstrap, Plotly, Flask and Heroku.

Pull data directly from the [World Bank API](), clean the data in the back-end using pandas, and then display the results on your front-end. This would be instead of using a csv file for your data.

## Project description

The main focus of this project is to practice how to pull data from an API, design a web app and deploy it to Heroku

## APIs Besides the World Bank
A few examples of public APIs include the [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs), the [Google Maps API](https://mapsplatform.google.com/), the [Facebook Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api), and the [US Government Data APIs](https://data.gov/developers/apis/).
